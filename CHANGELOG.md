All notable changes to Beijer.ink will be documented in this file.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **MAJOR** — Breaking changes (API, database schema)
- **MINOR** — New features, non-breaking enhancements
- **PATCH** — Bug fixes, small improvements

Current Version: **0.13.1**

---

## [0.13.1] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Switched email transport from Gmail SMTP (nodemailer) to **Resend** HTTP API — Railway blocks outbound SMTP traffic
- Enabled Express `trust proxy` for correct rate limiting behind Railway's reverse proxy

### Changed
- Environment variables simplified: `GMAIL_USER` + `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` replaced by single `RESEND_API_KEY`

---

## [0.13.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Password reset via email** — "Forgot password?" link on login page sends a reset email via Resend
- **Forgot password page** (`/forgot-password`) — Enter email, receive a reset link; generic success message prevents email enumeration
- **Reset password page** (`/reset-password/:token`) — Set a new password using a time-limited token (1 hour); auto-redirects to login on success
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` and `POST /api/auth/reset-password` endpoints
- Rate limiting on reset requests (3 per 15 minutes)
- `resetToken` and `resetExpires` fields on User model

### Setup required
- Set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `APP_URL` environment variables on Railway

---

## [0.12.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Download backup** — Settings → Data → "Download Backup" exports all notes as individual `.md` files in a zip archive, preserving the notebook folder hierarchy
- `GET /api/backup/download` endpoint streams a zip archive with `archiver`

### Changed
- **Collapsible settings sections** — Password change is now a collapsible row with icon, title, and description; click to expand the form

---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Table insert** — Markdown toolbar button to insert a 3-column table template
- **Markdown cheat sheet** — Built-in reference guide accessible via help icon in the toolbar, covering text formatting, headings, lists, blocks, tables, and more
- **Clickable app title** — Clicking "Beijer.ink" in the sidebar header refreshes the page

### Changed
- **Settings dialog refactored** — Now a proper settings area with scrollable sections; password change moved to its own `ChangePasswordSection` component, making it easy to add future settings sections

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Settings dialog** — Accessible via gear icon in the sidebar footer, opens a modal overlay
- **Change password** — Settings dialog includes a password change form with current/new/confirm fields, client-side validation (min 8 chars, match confirmation), and server-side verification
- `PUT /api/auth/password` endpoint with Zod validation and bcrypt hashing

---

## [0.9.1] — 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- Editor no longer auto-focuses on touch devices, preventing the keyboard from popping up immediately when opening a note on mobile

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Unified mobile/desktop sidebar** — Mobile now uses the same inline-notes sidebar as desktop; tapping a notebook expands it to show notes inline, tapping a note opens the editor
- Removed the separate NoteListPanel screen on mobile
- Mobile bottom nav simplified to 2 tabs (Notebooks / Editor) instead of 3
- Notebook clicks no longer close the mobile sidebar overlay — only note selection does

### Removed
- `NoteListPanel` import from mobile layout (kept in codebase for potential future use)
- "Notes" tab from mobile bottom navigation

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- Clicking a notebook on mobile now navigates to the note list instead of closing the sidebar without action

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- Bold text inside lists and blockquotes now renders at full brightness instead of inheriting the dimmer list/quote color

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Inline notes in sidebar** — Expanding a notebook now shows its notes directly in the sidebar tree (like a file explorer), eliminating the separate note list panel on desktop
- **New note from notebook menu** — Right-click a notebook and choose "New note" to create a note inside it
- **Note context menu in sidebar** — Right-click notes in the tree to move them between notebooks or delete them
- **Resizable sidebar** — Drag the divider between sidebar and editor to resize (180–400px range, persisted to localStorage)

### Changed
- Desktop layout reduced from 3 columns (sidebar + note list + editor) to 2 columns (sidebar + editor)
- Sidebar tree now renders a discriminated union of notebook and note nodes with lazy-loaded notes per expanded notebook
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home/End, Enter) works across both notebooks and notes in the tree
- ArrowLeft on a note navigates to its parent notebook; ArrowRight on notes is a no-op

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Root-level notes** — Notes can now exist outside of any notebook, appearing as individual items in the sidebar below the notebook tree
- **New note button** — FilePlus button in the sidebar header creates a root-level note instantly
- **Root note context menu** — Right-click to move a root note into a notebook or delete it
- **In-editor search highlighting** — Clicking a global search result highlights all matches in the editor with a floating navigation bar (arrow keys or prev/next buttons to jump between matches)

### Changed
- `notebookId` is now optional in the database schema — notes without a notebook are stored with `NULL` notebook_id
- Search uses `LEFT JOIN` so root notes appear in global search results (shown as "Root")
- Search highlight bar auto-focuses on mount so arrow keys work immediately

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added
- **CodeMirror 6 editor** — Notes and scratchpad now use CodeMirror 6 with inline markdown styling: bold text appears bold, headers are larger, code is highlighted, and markup characters (`**`, `##`, `` ` ``) remain visible but dimmed
- **Markdown toolbar** — Toggleable formatting toolbar with buttons for bold, italic, strikethrough, headings (H1–H3), inline code, links, bullet/ordered lists, blockquotes, and horizontal rules; toolbar state persisted in localStorage
- **Fullscreen mode** — Expand the note editor to fill the entire page (hides sidebar and note list); exit with Escape or the minimize button

### Changed
- Note list panel is hidden when no notebook is selected, giving the scratchpad more room on initial load
- Scratchpad uses monospace font to match the note editor

### Fixed
- Move to submenu no longer clipped by sidebar overflow — changed from right-flyout to inline expandable list
- Space bar and arrow keys now work correctly when renaming notebooks in the sidebar

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Notebook drag-and-drop removed (was unreliable); notebooks are now moved via right-click context menu "Move to" submenu
- Sidebar restyled to be more Obsidian-like: tighter spacing, subtler selection, folder open/closed icons, muted colors
- Context menu now includes "New sub-notebook" option to create child notebooks inline

### Removed
- Notebook dragging (useDraggable) and root drop zone; note-to-notebook drag-and-drop is preserved
- `SidebarDropRoot` component

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Editor replaced: TipTap WYSIWYG removed, replaced with plain `<textarea>` and monospace font
- First line of note content is now the title (no separate title field)
- Title auto-derived on server from first line of content
- Note list preview shows lines 2+ of content (line 1 is the title)

- Formatting toolbar, table menu, find & replace, image resize
- Tag system (TagPicker, TagBadge, Tag/NoteTag database tables)
- Image upload and Cloudflare R2 integration (Image table dropped)

- Client bundle reduced from 860KB to 395KB

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-24

### Added
- Drag-and-drop notebooks into other notebooks to create nested folder hierarchies
- Drag notebooks to root drop zone to un-nest them back to top level
- Drag notes from the note list onto sidebar notebooks to move between notebooks

- Touch drag support for Android (press-and-hold 200ms to start dragging)
- Drag overlay preview showing notebook/note name while dragging

### Fixed

- Content now reliably persists when switching between notes (pending saves are flushed on note switch)
- `setContent` during note loading no longer triggers spurious auto-saves to the wrong note
- Title changes in the editor now update the note list instantly (optimistic cache update)
- Title-only changes are no longer silently dropped by the debounce dedup logic

### Changed
- Sidebar notebook tree refactored from recursive rendering to flat list for dnd-kit hook compatibility

- Auto-saves scratchpad content with 1-second debounce, persisted in PostgreSQL
